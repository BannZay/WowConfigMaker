Wow Config Maker is a simple tool which allows you to generate game configuration scripts. This script is able to configure (by setting up realmlist and/or account name with values you specified) and run Wow.

How to use:
1) Start World of Warcraft
2) Login on server to character list window (optional - click "Remember Account Name" on login screen if you want it to be stored in config)
3) Drag & Drop your World of Warcraft folder (which contains Wow.exe) on MakeWowConfig.bat
    If wow execution file located at D:\World of Warcraft\Wow.exe you should drag and drop "World of Warcraft" folder on this script.
    new configuration file should be generated at WowConfigMaker.bat location
4) Just use newly generated script to start Wow with propriate settings.

Additional step:
5) Repeat 1-3 steps for each game server or login name you going to use.

How it works:
Script reads your WOW folder to get current game settings to store it in configuration script. When you run generated configuration script it just restores saved game settings.
