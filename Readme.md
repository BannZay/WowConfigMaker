Wow Config Maker is a simple tool which allows you to generate wow configuration scripts. 
Such script can configure your Wow (set appropriate realmlist, account name, etc) before running.

How to use:
1) Run Wow, login on server to character list window (Click "Remember Account Name" on login screen if you want it to be stored in config file)
2) Drag & Drop your World of Warcraft folder (where Wow.exe located) on MakeWowConfig.bat
3) Use generated SERVERNAME.bat configuration script to run your Wow

Additional step:
4) Repeat 1-3 steps for each game server or login name you use

How it works:
Script reads your WOW folder to get current game settings to store it in configuration script. When you run generated configuration script it just restores saved game settings.
